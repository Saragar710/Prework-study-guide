# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework for web development. So far we have dabbled in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. With the tutorials and being able to reachout to tutors who are well versed in this field, I find this to be very helpful. Although to get to this point I had to restart three times. I have learned you can not learn coding in a few days, when you have never really worked with computers. It all takes time. Rome wasn't build in a day, and neither was coding. Don't give up!

## Usage

In this Prework Study Guide we have scratched the surface of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. In each file you will see a small portion of what I have learned on each section. In JavaScript you can use the DevTools console to see your actual JavaScript code running. It is an amazing tool, because if you make a mistake there are options for you to see where you went wrong and how you can fix it. It is itemized so you can chose which section to study first.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
